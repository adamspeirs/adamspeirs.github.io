**Hello, and welcome to this wicked beta Github site!** 

I am Adam Speirs, and hereâ€™s a little bit about me professionally:

I have worked in academic, private, and public archives since 2007, and am currently working with Douglas County Libraries at the Douglas County History Research Center in Castle Rock, Colorado.

I hold a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature with a minor in Linguistics, and a Masters of Library and Information Science: Archives, Preservation, and Records Management from the University of Pittsburgh School of Information Science.

I am currently serving on the board of the Society of Rocky Mountain Archivists as Programs Director, working to build professional education opportunities in the region and facilitate biannual regional conferences.***

I also have a few areas of research interest and specialization that are worth highlighting:

* Digital Preservation
* Archives Management
* Copyright and Intellectual Property Rights
* Professional Education and Outreach
* Community Engagement
* Oral History

I also have a personal website over at [adamspeirs.com](https://adamspeirs.com)
