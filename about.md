Hereâ€™s a little bit about me professionally:

I have worked in academic, private, public and government archives since 2007, and am currently working with Denver Water, Colorado's oldest and largest water utility.

I hold a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature with a minor in Linguistics, and a Masters of Library and Information Science: Archives, Preservation, and Records Management from the University of Pittsburgh School of Information Science.

A few areas of research interest and specialization that are worth highlighting:

* Digital Preservation
* Information Governance
* Professional Education and Outreach
* Community Engagement
